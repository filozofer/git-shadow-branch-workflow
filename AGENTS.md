# AGENTS.md

This repository uses **git-shadow**.

If you are an AI coding agent, assistant, or automated contributor, you must follow the workflow described below.

---

## Core principle

```text
code for thinking  ≠  code for collaboration
```

This repository separates development into two layers:

feature/x@local   → thinking workspace
feature/x         → published branch

The @local branch is for exploration, reasoning, debug code, pseudo-code, and local-only comments.
The public branch is for clean, reviewable, shareable code.

## Agent behavior rules

1. Default to the shadow branch

Always prefer working in the @local branch when available.
Example: feature/login@local
Do not treat the public branch as the primary workspace for iterative reasoning.

2. Use @local as a cognitive workspace

In the shadow branch, you are encouraged to write and preserve:
- reasoning comments
- implementation plans
- pseudo-code
- temporary debug code
- intermediate refactors
- local-only TODO notes
- hypotheses and exploration artifacts

Examples:
```ts
/// plan:
/// 1. validate token
/// 2. retry on 429
/// 3. persist refreshed token

/// @local debug
console.log('SSO profile', profile)
```

These artifacts are useful in @local and should not be removed prematurely.

3. Do not prematurely optimize for cleanliness in @local

When working in the shadow branch:
- prefer explicit reasoning over premature cleanup
- keep useful comments if they help thinking
- keep exploratory code while a task is still in progress
- do not erase cognitive context too early

In @local, clarity of thought is more important than polish.

4. Publish only clean code

Before publishing to the public branch, choose what to keep as local-only artifacts such as:
- /// comments
- // @local comments
- debug logs
- temporary probes
- unfinished pseudo-code
- local-only planning notes

What will be usefull to keep for later usage as a memory ? 
These things must be commited inside a separate commits prefixed by "[MEMORY] " in order to allow git shadow to filter them during the publish process.

Published code must be:
- readable
- minimal
- production-ready
- suitable for code review

5. Preferred workflow

```bash
git shadow new-feature <branch-name>
# THEN WORK
# Clean code as explain in "4. Publish only clean code"
git shadow commit
git shadow feature publish
git push origin <branch-name>
```

If you are asked to finalize work, prefer publication through git-shadow rather than manually copying noisy changes to the public branch.

6. Git shadow configuration

Use this command to retrieve all the git shadow config :
```bash
git shadow config show --json
```

7. Separation of responsibilities
Layer	Purpose
@local	think, explore, debug, iterate
public branch	publish, review, share
Agent decision rule

Use this rule at all times:

If a change helps thinking, it belongs in @local.
If a change is ready to be shared, it belongs in the public branch.

## Intent

The goal is not only to keep the repository clean.

The goal is to preserve a valuable truth:
how code is produced ≠ how code is shared

git-shadow exists to protect both.

Short reminder
Use @local to think.
Use publish to share.
