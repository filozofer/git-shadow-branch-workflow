# Git Shadow

**Think in code. Publish clean code.**

Git Shadow introduces the **Shadow Branch Pattern**, a Git workflow that lets developers keep **local thinking artifacts** (comments, notes, exploration code) without polluting the shared repository.

This toolkit provides a small set of commands and hooks that create a **shadow branch workflow**:

```
feature/login@local   ← local thinking layer
feature/login         ← collaboration layer push to the remote repository
```

Your local branch can contain:

- design comments
- algorithm sketches
- architecture notes
- debugging helpers
- AI memory files

But the published branch remains **clean and reviewable**.

The result: 
Write the comments, structure and tools you need to think.
Publish only the code your team needs to read.

# Why this exists

Software development involves two different layers:

- **Code for collaboration** — the code shared with the team, reviewed, and maintained over time.
- **Code for thinking** — the temporary structures developers (or IA 🤖) use to reason about problems.

These thinking structures can include:

- exploratory comments
- algorithm outlines
- debugging helpers
- architecture notes

They are useful during development but are often considered noise in a shared repository.

Git Shadow introduces the **Shadow Branch Pattern** to solve this tension.

Developers can keep their personal thinking layer locally while publishing **clean, reviewable code** to the team repository.

Additionally, Git Shadow supports [AI-assisted development](#ai-assisted-development) by providing a transparent memory layer for AI tools.

# Concept

Each feature exists in **two branches**.

```
feature/login@local   ← local thinking layer
feature/login         ← collaboration layer push to the remote repository
```

Your development happens in the `@local` branch.

When you finish working and want to commit your work you can call the git publish command :

```
git shadow publish
```

The toolkit:

1. strips `/// ` comments (or other pattern you configure)
2. creates two commits : one with your changes and one with your local comments
3. then cherry-picks it to the public branch

---

# Installation

## 1 Clone the toolkit

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filozofer/git-local-comments-workflow.git
```

---

## 2 Configure environment if you want to

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You can adapt to your needs.
Example configuration:

```
WORKSPACE_DIR="../"
PUBLIC_BASE_BRANCH="develop"
LOCAL_SUFFIX="@local"
LOCAL_COMMENT_PATTERN='^[[:space:]]*(///|##|---|;;|%%|<!---|/\*\*|\*)'

```

---

## 3 Make `git shadow` available

Option 1 (recommended): add the toolkit `bin` folder to your PATH, then use the wrapper directly:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
# now you can run:
# git shadow commit -m "message"
# git shadow publish
```

Option 2: create a Git alias :

```bash
git config --global alias.shadow "!sh /chemin/vers/git-shadow/bin/git-shadow"
```

---

## 4 Install the pre-commit hook

```bash
git shadow install-hook
```

The hook prevents accidental commits containing your local comment pattern (by default one extra comment marker, see LOCAL_COMMENT_PATTERN env var).
The hook will not provoke error on other team members environments if they haven't install git shadow.

---


## Doctor

`git shadow doctor` checks the toolkit installation and current project repository status.

- checks essential toolkit scripts and configuration.
- checks git availability.
- checks `git shadow` command presence.
- checks current repo status (clean/staged, current branch).

```bash
git shadow doctor
```

---

# Create a feature

```bash
git shadow new-feature feature/login
```

Creates:

```
feature/login
feature/login@local
```

and switches to:

```
feature/login@local
```

---

# Work locally

Write your code normally on your "@local" branch.

Example (look at the triple "/" used for comments here):

```ts
  /// Get user from database
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { email },
  })
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('Invalid credentials')
  }

  /// Verify if user is able to connect
  if (!user.isActive) {
    throw new Error('User account is disabled')
  }

  /// Verify user password
  const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash)
  if (!isPasswordValid) {
    throw new Error('Invalid credentials')
  }

  /// Build session for user
  const session = await prisma.session.create({
    data: {
      userId: user.id,
      token: crypto.randomUUID(),
      createdAt: new Date(),
    },
  })

```

---

# Publish work

```bash
git add .
git shadow commit -m "feat(auth): user login function"
git shadow publish

# OR 
git add .
git shadow publish --commit -m "feat(auth): user login function"
```

This:

1. removes local comments from staged code
2. commits your changes in two commits : one with your changes and one with your local comments
3. cherry-picks the commits without comments from your @local branch to the public branch (every commit with a title which begin by [MEMORY] are not cherry-picked)

Push normally:

```bash
git push origin feature/login
```

If you have commits which you only want to keep in your shadow branch your can prefix them with "[MEMORY]" inside theirs titles.
Example of usages : 
- Remove some form validations rules inside your dev env only
- Local env improvements which your team does not want to use
- Scripts for your usage only
- Memory markdowns files for your local agent

---

# Finish a feature

After the MR is merged :

```bash
git shadow finish-feature
```

This command:

* updates your main branch (default : `develop`)
* merges your main branch into his "@local" shadow branch (default: `develop@local`)
* merges `feature@local` into `develop@local`
* optionally deletes feature branches

(every branch naming is configurable inside your own .env file)

---

# Workflow overview

```
develop
   │
   ├── feature/login
   │
develop@local
   │
   └── feature/login@local
```

Your develop@local branches keep design comments and local features permanently.

---

# Example daily workflow

Create feature:

```bash
git shadow new-feature feature/user-login
```

Work normally on your @local branch

Publish:

```bash
git shadow publish --commit -m "feat(auth): user login function"
git push
```

Finish after your branch has been merge on the main branch :

```bash
git shadow finish-feature
```

# ✨ AI-assisted development

Modern development increasingly involves AI assistants.

This introduces a new challenge:  
AI tools often lack persistent, transparent project memory.

Developers repeatedly have to reintroduce context through prompts, while the AI builds implicit assumptions about the codebase that remain hidden and difficult to correct.

Git Shadow unintentionally provides an interesting foundation for solving this problem.

Because the shadow branch (`@local`) is never published, it can safely contain:
- exploration code
- temporary reasoning
- architecture notes
- AI-generated summaries of the codebase
- domain knowledge shortcuts

For a deeper dive into how Git Shadow can serve as a memory layer for AI-assisted development, see [Git Shadow as an AI Memory Layer](docs/git-shadow-as-ia-memory-layer.md).

## Shadow Branch Pattern

Git Shadow implements a workflow called the **Shadow Branch Pattern**.

**[Shadow Branch Pattern](docs/shadow-branch-pattern.md)**: Detailed explanation of the underlying pattern, including motivation, workflow, benefits, and trade-offs.

---

# Drawbacks

- **Additional workflow complexity** : The shadow branch pattern adds an extra layer to your Git workflow through dual branches and additional commands. This requires a small learning curve and may not be necessary for all projects.

- **Local-only information** : Your team members won’t benefit from your local commits, since that is the purpose of this pattern. Your local reasoning is therefore not directly visible to others, and important insights may still need to be promoted to shared documentation or code when relevant.

-  **Conflict management** : Since `@local` branches diverge from public branches, you may encounter merge conflicts when updating your base branch, rebasing, or finishing features. These conflicts are usually straightforward (often limited to comments), but they introduce some maintenance overhead.

- **Not always necessary** : Everything Git Shadow does can be achieved manually with Git. Its value lies in automation, consistency, and reduced cognitive load. For simple workflows or small projects, the pattern may be unnecessary.

Like any abstraction, Git Shadow is most valuable when the benefits of separating thinking from collaboration outweigh the additional workflow complexity.

# Testing

Git Shadow includes a test suite using [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (Bash Automated Testing System).

To run the tests:

1. Install Bats:
   - On macOS: `brew install bats-core`
   - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install bats`
   - On Windows: Use WSL or install via npm: `npm install -g bats`

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   cd tests
   ./run-tests.sh
   ```

The test suite includes:
- Individual tests for each subcommand (`new-feature.bats`, `publish.bats`, etc.)
- A comprehensive workflow test (`workflow.bats`) that validates the complete feature development cycle

---

# Status

Git Shadow is currently evolving.

The core workflow is already usable for daily development, but the project is still improving and the CLI may evolve as the pattern matures.

---

# Related tools

Several tools extend Git workflows in different ways:

- **Graphite**, **ghstack**, **StGit** — manage stacked changes and patch series
- **git-flow** — structures branching strategies for team collaboration

Git Shadow focuses on a different dimension: separating **local thinking layer** from **clean collaboration branches** through the Shadow Branch Pattern.
